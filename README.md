= Lunchlink

A lightweight app to see who's next to cook lunch in our little
lunch club.

Run it by git clone then:

    bundle
    foreman start

= Possible future ideas?

 * Member management
 * Allow multiple lunch clubs, each with own members
 * Each lunch could have details of what will be cooked
 * Storage of recipes used for others to lookup later
 * Payment gateway? :)
